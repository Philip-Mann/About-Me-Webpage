    <h1>Philip Mann - Switching gears while changing careers.</h1>

    <p>I am a 29 year old Truck Driver looking to hang up the keys and join the tech world. For the past 4 years, I have been hauling</p>
    <p>liquid chemicals throughout the continental US and Canada. My primary duties besides driving consist of loading/unloading, staying</p>
    <p>up to date on my hours of service, complying with federal and state laws, and maintaining customer relationships by punctual</p> 
    <p>and professional. I am driven and hungry for the change. I strive to be an expert at my craft with pride in my professionalism and</p> 
    <p>attention to detail. The long days and nights in trucking have cemented a work ethic that I am proud to bring into the tech world.</p>
